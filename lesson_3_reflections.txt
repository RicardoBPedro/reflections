When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 - It's useful to share my code and work in a team.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 - Because I could need to do some changes or tests in my local repository before up-to-dte with the remote repository.

 Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  - Branches are diferents versions of the same file. Clones are copies of some repository and Forks are a clone between GitHub accounts.

  What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
   - If you got a trouble you would easy restore.

 Commands:
git remote  = Show all remote locations for the repository.
git remote add origin url = Add a new remote location for the repository
git remove -v = Outputs the remote locations with verbose information.
git push origin master = Push the master branch to the remote location origin.
git pull origin master = Get the master branch from the remote location origin.
git pull origin master = Git fetch origin + git merge master origin/master.
git fetch origin = Get the changes from the remote location into the (hidden?) origin/master branch.
